# Roman Numerals

Implement a function that when given an integer input, will produce output in [Roman Numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals) format.

## Requirements

- Your solution should work for all inputs from 1 to 3999.

- It should throw an `Error` if the input is not within the range of 1-3999. The error message should be `Input out of range`.

- It should thrown an `Error` if the input is not an integer. The error message should be `Input must be an integer`.

## Examples

`2  => II`

`5  => V`

`9  => IX`

`1066 => MLXVI`

`2024 => MMXXIV`

`3999 => MMMCMXCIX`

## Before you start

> Please ensure you have disabled any AI assistants in your IDE or editor. This is to ensure that it is your own coding ability that is being tested.

## What we are looking for

1. A correct solution that implements **all** the requirements.
2. A suite of tests that prove the correctness of your solution.
3. A solution that is readable and maintainable.

## Final Advice

- As time is limited we encourage you to focus on implementing the conversion from integer to Roman numerals first & worry about error handling later.
- We also encourage you to talk as you are thinking (but try to remember that your interviewers are already familiar with Typescript so you don't need to explain every line of code you write).
- Remember that you can ask for help if you are stuck or need a nudge in the right direction.
